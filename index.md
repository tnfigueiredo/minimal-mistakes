<h1 id="page-title" class="page__title">Be Welcome!</h1>

This spot came up to centralize and facilitate the content publishing I write, as also for sharing articles and relevant topics
I believe that are interesting. It will also complement my LinkedIn activities. Besides that, I will keep references to my
Github and for ideas and projects I use in my experimental process.

Probably the content of my Github repositories become more focused to give instructions to run their experimental process, bringing into articles here theoretical foundation which concerns experimentation.

I'm open to suggestions, contributions, and also for doubts clarifying. Be welcome.
